   version 1.3, Januaray 9, 2005. 
       (1) Top margin of the layput changed in asme2e.cls.
       asme2e.cls1.2 is for ASME DETC template version 1.2.

       (2) Updated asmms4.bst to conform the ASME reference format.
       It fixes 2 items in the article format: 1) a extraneous space 
       after number or month was removed, and 2) an incorrect font style 
       that occurred for one particular combination of number 
       and month data was corrected. It also adjusts capitalization 
       in proceedings entries to correspond to the latest ASME reference 
       format. The current ASME reference format still does not 
       completely resolve all formatting issues. In particular, 
       the sample bibliography uses roman style for journal names  
       in an article citation, but the reference format doesn't 
       actually specify a style for the journal name. Since there's 
       some ambiguity here, I left the journal name italicized.
